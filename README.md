**Google Cloud DevOps Project: Deploying a Live Weather App on Cloud Run**
Within this repository, you'll discover the essential source code and deployment files needed to orchestrate a live weather app on Cloud Run using Docker.

**Overview**
In this project, I'll walk you through building a Python weather app, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it on Cloud Run. 
We'll leverage the OpenWeather API for live weather updates! Moreover, the entire process will be automated with a CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build.

**Key Highlights**
